# Python Game
A Galaga-like game I created, currently a work in progress, messy and there are things I want to add.

To-Do list
Clean up the code
Create levels if a certain amount of tie fighters die
Add a story line to the game
Create unique characters instead of star wars
Refine movement and shooting
